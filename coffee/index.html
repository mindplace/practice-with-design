          <p>
            From its humble public beginnings in a shed set up as London's first coffee house, coffee drinking transformed, over the course of half a century, from being a foreign, heathen Turkish tradition practiced at the expense of a Christian soul, to an accepted drink of the new culture of political debate, with all the mutual and established connotations of sobriety, intelligence, and non-debauched sociability.
          </p>
          <p>
            There exists excellent archival evidence that throws light upon this progression, yet few scholars have turned their eyes to the commodity of coffee itself, as generally scholarly attention turned to this particular commodity focuses upon the rise of the coffee houses in the late 17th century. Coffee house culture was only secondarily that of collective coffee consumption: it was a space for political debate, exchange, and sociability centered on non-boisterous and non-debauched public interaction. That makes the question of coffee itself, as the presumed basis for such gatherings, interesting—yet social reflections on coffee as an object, an available commodity, have not been adequately addressed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Coffee is difficult to extract from the space of coffee houses, where it was overwhelmingly sold and consumed, and with which it was associated. But it had in fact been a privately consumed item in England for much of the 17th century before becoming publicly sold in coffee houses, and many contemporary discussions of coffee culture often looked specifically at coffee itself and not just at the coffee houses. Such social responses may be found in texts that discuss coffee directly, particularly in several texts printed during the latter half of the seventeenth century, the early rise of English coffee houses. These texts shine a fascinating light on opinions regarding coffee: sometimes social, sometimes medicinal, often mixed. All these texts represent participation in an ongoing social struggle to determine coffee's place in English culture, as the commodity of coffee throughout this period is 'fitful and uncertain' and remains that way until the 1720s. Coffee in this moment, as any other foreign novelty, was something 'to be looked at askance'.

        <section id="history">
          <h2>How did coffee get to England?</h2>

          <p>
            Coffee came to England slowly, becoming a widely-consumed product primarily after the opening of the first coffee shop in London, most likely in 1652. The coffee drinking habit was imported from Ottoman-controlled Turkey by English travelers and traders, although coffee houses and coffee drinking had only been established in Istanbul after 1554. English travelers and Levant Company traders began to import coffee to England for private consumption, where it was at first consumed and discussed primarily by English virtuosi, men of science and learning. Among these was William Harvey, a well-known physician who discovered the circulation of the blood, who most likely began drinking coffee as early as 1627. Others were Thomas Howard, the fourteenth Earl of Arundel, and Francis Bacon. Bacon in particular wrote extensively on coffee and some excerpted texts entered circulation and publication throughout the 17th century.

        <section id="health">
          <h2>Interesting Health Claims</h2>

          <p>
            Public coffee consumption was introduced into London through Daniel Edwards, an up-and-coming merchant of the Levant Company. Edwards kept a manservant from Ottoman-controlled Smyrna, named Pasqua Rosee, whom he had hired after a long period abroad in that country. When Edwards returned to England, he brought home, along with Rosee, a coffee-drinking habit, to the interest of his friends. Noting this interest, Edwards conceived of an idea—along with his father-in-law, Thomas Hodges, originally of the Grocers Company—to open an establishment within which people could purchase coffee for their own use. However, they were prevented from doing so themselves because the Levant Company forbade their traders to keep shops. Instead, Edwards decided to sponsor Rosee in opening this coffee shop and to be the face of that establishment. In addition to prepared coffee, their shop probably sold ground coffee and coffee beans. The shop printed what was perhaps the first public advertisement for coffee, titled 'The Vertue of the Coffee Drink', containing a list of coffee's 'vertues' and the shop's address, and was reprinted a number of times over the next two decades. Ellis suggests that this advertisement was 'probably folded up and enclosed in parcels of retail coffee beans' and perhaps was also handed out or posted on walls. The advertisement details how coffee should be drunk and during what times of the day, and claims it is good for digestion, eyes, headaches, coughs, dropsy, gout, scurvy, miscarriage, and the spleen, as well as good for one's spirits and prevents drowsiness, which virtue can 'make one fit for business'. Its qualities are claimed to be 'cold and dry' in that it does not heat or inflame the body—which was part of the standard theory of humors in effect at this time—but has a 'drying' effect, although this is not explained or elaborated.
          </p>

          <p>
            These health claims are perhaps derived from sources such as Bacon, who discussed coffee in both his Sylva Sylvarum and Historia Vitae et Mortis, in which he classified coffee together with 'betel roots and leaves, tobacco, and opium' as being 'of the same nature with opiates', and thought so well of coffee for its medicinal properties that he wrote he would rather prescribe coffee for a sick person than send them to the apothecary. Bacon wrote that coffee 'comforteth the Brain, and Heart, and helpeth Digestion'. These health claims, as well as those  the coffee advertisement of 1652, are repeated in the texts of advocates and critics of coffee alike, whether to support or attack them, but this repetition strongly suggests that these claims were widely spread and believed.
          </p>

          <p>
            One such text that raises these claims to refute them is 'The Maidens Complaint', which argues that while coffee, in its dryness, may be good for getting phlegm out of the stomach, the nature of humans is such that this and other problems return again within a short period of time, more strongly than before in that 'the house being thus swept and cleaned, seven Devils enter it'. While the text here does not refute the original health claim but merely labels it useless, it does consider other medical claims more critically. It argues that not only does coffee not prevent 'the Stone, / The Palsie, Dropsie, Gout, Feaver and Ptisick' among others, it actually causes them, and elaborates this claim in a dialogue between a charlatan and an apothecary. A character called Antidote, in language parodying that of a physician, claims that coffee is a 'rare liquor, good for several diseases, an infallible Medicine I'le promise you for the Gout, Consumption, Dropsie, Ptisick, and all other Maladies' yet aside to his apothecary friend, confides that coffee 'is the only liquor in the universe, to fill the body with diseases, it drys up the brains, putrifies the blood, shrinks up the Sinews, Nerves, Arteries and corodes upon every part of the body' and adds that he is now 'sure to have patients enow infected to fill my Coffers'. Through Antidote, who is introduced on the cover of the pamphlet as a 'mountibank'—charlatan or quack—the text insinuates that anyone making such medical claims for coffee's medicinal powers fabricates them entirely as a means of making money. Of course, in regards to the original advertisement of Rosee's, this insinuation surely holds some truth. In the same text, in a dialogue between Dorothy and Jean, stand-ins for all womenkind, complain that the coffee their men are drinking makes them 'dry' and that this will shorten their lives and make a 'Jaques' of their brains, a 'chimney of his noddle'. The claim that coffee hurts the brain is interesting for the term 'Jaques', being a disparagingly French reference. One woman then claims that rather than drink coffee, she would prefer to 'wrap my Maiden-head in my smock, and fling it into the Ocean to be bugger'd to death by young Lobsters', appealing to the reader's sense of shock, outrage, and perhaps low-brow humor. Still, what the (male) author here tries to build is an association between drinking coffee and the loss of female sexual availability. The other character answers that she would rather 'hang my Maiden-head on a Wind-mill to be bated to death by the four Winds, rather than be poyson'd with the scent of old crusts, and threads of Leather burn'd and beaten to powder, of which I believe this cursed Coffee is made'. Here, the smell of coffee is textually intensified by the mention of the 'four Winds', thereby intensifying the effect of its description. In other texts, coffee is similarly disparaged as 'A loathsome Potion...Syrrop of Soot, or Effence of old Shooes'.
          </p>

          <p>
            In response to 'The Maidens Complaint' is printed another satirical pamphlet titled 'The Coffee-Mans Granado Discharged Upon the Maidens Complaint Against Coffee', which satirizes the first in mimicking its style of informing through dialogue. The text presents itself as a proponent of coffee in opposition to 'The Maidens Complaint', but actually uses the fact of the first to further criticize coffee while pretending to advocate for it. It calls coffee 'infallible for all Maladies' and proposes to list the 'rare Cures' that coffee drinking inspired, such as this one:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            Rickard Banco of Catolongo lay of a dead Palsie three years, and drinking Coffee, was so perfectly cur'd, that the next day he was seen to go throrow the High-street upon 4 mens shoulders, to the admiration of his Neighbours who had not seen him some years before.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Of course, after this miraculous experience, Banco dies the next day. The text nevertheless presents this and other terrible events as wonderful and desirable—in one of these 'rare Cures', a character who had suffered from coffee expresses an intention to write a book to the praise of it, which one of the characters holding dialogue comments on, saying he intends to purchase the book when it is printed.
          </p>
        </section>

        <p>
          Another 'cure' is of a sexual nature: 'Benjamin Bad-cock drank Coffee in Layden, and his Wife...remained barren four years, after which he left drinking Coffee, and in three quarters of a year she had a goodly chopping boy'. This was a common attack on coffee from the beginning of coffee's presence in England. Both advocates and critics widely discussed the concept of 'dryness' of coffee—its ability to stimulate the mind and reduce fluids in the body, among them male sperm and, by extension, male virility, and inhibiting the sexuality of both sexes. The German physician Simon Paulli, in a tract published in 1665, first suggested this theory in Europe. Adam Olearius, another German physician, also claimed it, in the embassy to Persia in the Ottoman Empire, in a travel text written in 1634 and translated to English from German. The text was  England in 1663, in which Olearius wrote that the Persians believe coffee lowers male virility. It is repeated in most of the texts discussing coffee in this period in claiming that 'Coffee, that curs'd liquor disables the most valiant Hectors in the universe'. The newly enfeebled and sexually incapacitated quality of men, 'The Women's Petition' argues, must be attributed to
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          nothing more than the Excessive use of that Newfangled, Abonimable, Heathenish Liquor called Coffee, which Riffling Nature of her Choicest Treasures, and Drying up the Radical Moisture, as so Eunuch our Husbands, and Crippled our more kind Gallants, that they are become as Impotent, as Age, and as unfruitful as those Defarts whence that unhappy Berry is said to be brought.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Here, coffee, in its dryness, acts upon male fluids to make them impotent. This text belongs to another mock petition positioning itself as having been written by a group of concerned women. It in part echoes a text published 13 years previously, which claims that drinkers of 'pernicious' coffee are 'grown as impotent as Age, as dry and unfruitful as the Deferts of Africk', a text similarly styled as a petition to the king to make coffee drinking illegal to anyone under the age of 30.
        </p>

        <p>
          'The Women's Petition' was answered by a text defending coffee against the original's attacks, published in the same year under the title 'The Mens Answer to the Womens Petition Against Coffee'. It calls coffee an 'innocent', 'harmless and healing Liquor'. The text goes on to claim that far from inhibiting male virility, coffee 'makes the erection more Vigorous, the Ejaculation more full, adds a spiritualescency to the Sperme, and renders it more firm and suitable to the Gusto of the womb, and proportionate to the ardours and expectation too, of the female Paramour'. As the text it is responding to, its claims are styled as scientific fact, presumably rigorously researched, yet unsupported in both tracts. These discussions of sexual virility employ the base language of the people within the framework of the petition or complaint, styles that were created to appeal to authority but used here satirically to appeal to the people, participating in the textual culture of restoration satire.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, claims of coffee as impacting health represent only one type of criticism and social responses that coffee garnered. Coffee was often positioned as being inherently non-English: sometimes Turkish, sometimes hellish, often simply 'forein'. Proponents of coffee tended to mention its Turkish origins as part of its history, while critics used such facts to suggest that in being non-English, coffee was therefore not fit for English consumption. The 'Maidens Complaint Against Coffee' calls it an 'Indian liquor' that 'is a drench for the Devil', noting that 'Indian' and hellish are not necessarily unrelated concepts to a nationalistic-minded writer. It adds that coffee ''twill poison a horse',  implying that it would poison a (smaller, more feeble) human all the faster. Calling coffee a drink for the Devil, or claiming that coffee gets its heat from hell, also recurs throughout texts critical of coffee, with some texts claiming that 'Rather than I will such damn'd liquor take, / I'le drink the waters of the Stygian Lake', while another calls coffee a 'Satanick Tipple'. These criticisms relate the sense that coffee drinking is immoral, tying the concepts of foreignness and hellishness together under the arch of Christian morality. The critics use religious language to discredit coffee, creating the strongest appeal they imagined would affect a Christian reader.
        </p>

        <p>
          The more common explanation of the immorality of coffee in these texts comes from the association between Islam and coffee consumption. Pasqua Rosee, previously mentioned as the face and proprietor of the first coffee shop in London, was an immigrant from Ottoman-controlled Smyrna. His shop was decorated in a style reminiscent of the Ottoman Empire, and it was this fact, as well as the fact that Rosee did not speak English well, that contributed to the already-established association between coffee and foreign culture, which had already been in place thanks to the publication of travel writing. This association was compounded by later coffee houses, which typically displayed Turkish iconology on their signs. The association between Islam and coffee provided, for critics, straightforward evidence for the immoral nature of coffee drinking. Some texts consider coffee with simple suspicion, calling it a 'Turkish Enchantress', an insinuation that coffee has a magical and disastrous effect on a Christian's soul. Another, echoing common Christian teaching, reminds readers that 'No Faith is to be kept with Infidels' within a poem that stresses the foreign and dangerous qualities of coffee in depicting a marriage between an 'Islamic [coffee] bean and innocent Christian water'. Contemporary culture still regarded the Ottoman Empire as 'a vehicle for the forces of the Anti-Christ', which still inspired demands to go on holy war against the Muslims. Under such circumstances, Turkish customs, no matter how recently introduced to that part of the world, were still fraught, for the English public, with associations with immorality. One woodcut, accompanying a text critical of coffee, depicts exotic figures mingling with English customers, appealing to viewers who presumably shared fears of such improper mixes with the artist. This fear was directly represented textually in a satirical poem:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          For Men and Christians to turn Turks, and think<br>
           T' excuse the Crime because 'tis in their drink,<br>
           Is more then Magick, and does plainly tell<br>
          Coffee's extraction has its heats from Hell. 
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The fear outlined here is that Christians take moral risks in mixing with Turks in their habits. The suggestion is also that coffee's temptation is hellish, and this is aligned, as before, with the foreignness and immorality that is depicted to be inherently Turkish. The same poem calls coffee drinkers 'English Apes', in that Englishmen mimic the Turks by drinking coffee as though they are worthy of emulation, and moreover, that coffee drinkers become as animals in their repudiation of Englishness by partaking of foreign consumption. Another text similarly complains that 'the Offspring of our Mighty Ancestors Dwindled into a Succession of Apes and Pignies' through coffee-drinking. Yet another likens coffee consumers to 'Apes' and 'Slaves' in imitating the peoples of other nations: 'With the Barbarous Indian he smoaks Tobacco. With the Turk he drinks Coffee', implying that sharing such actions diminishes the civility and Christianity of the consumer. This foreignness of coffee and its immorality is constantly contrasted with the Englishness of alcohol: 'instead of Coffee, wee'l have a cup of wholesome Ale' with the implication that coffee, in its foreign nature, is poisonous and unhealthy for English constitutions, perhaps intended to be so by the Devil. Critics complained that coffee drinkers neglect alcohol, the proper drink of Englishmen: 'by this poor Arabian Berry, / Comes the Neglect of Malago and Sherry'. Others again make a connection between moral danger and foreign goods, in saying that men who drink coffee 'Apostize from the good old primitive way of Ale-drinking, to run whoreing after such variety of distructive Foraign Liquors...all for a little base, black, thick, nasty, bitter, stinking, nauseous Puddle-water'.
        </p>

        <p>
          Advocates of coffee responded to the coffee-alcohol debate by stressing the fact that coffee induces sobriety and alertness, which qualities were used to contrast with alcohol in praise of coffee. In challenge of this, 'The Women's Petition' claims that men 'pretend 'twill [coffee] keep them Waking, but we find by scurvy Experience, they sleep quietly enough after it'. Still, the pervasive association between coffee and sobriety suggests that coffee and coffee house patrons were claiming possession of that and similar qualities of civil sociability in drinking coffee. John Beale, for example, wrote of hopes that coffee 'may bee a meanes to put drunkennes out of countenance'. A 1674 poem similarly contrasts coffee with alcohol in expressing the hope that coffee means an end to debauched sociability:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          the sweet Poison of the Treacherous Grape,<br>
          Had Acted on the world a General Rape,<br>
          [...] Then Heaven in Pity, to Effect our Cure,<br>
          And stop the Ragings of that Calenture,<br>
          First sent amongst us this All-healing Berry,<br>
          At once to make us both Sober and Merry.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Coffee is here connected to heaven, just as critics claim its alignment with hell, yet both suggest that one drink is meant to supplant the other, or that one drink will soothe the negative effects of the other, as 'Maidens Complaint' claims ale will do for coffee:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          I travel'd to the Royal Exchange, to collect certain sums of mony due to my Master...and by the confused noise of several Languages, I was so confounded in my noddle that my brains ran to and fro like a foot-boy...I went into a Coffee-house, took a dish of that Hell-burn'd liquor, thinking to settle them [my brains] in their right Center, with the ratling noice of Kettles, Skimers and Ladles amongst the Brasiers, my brains run round so swift as a Wind-mill, and all my joynts were as num as an old Womans trubled with the dead Palsy 30 years togather, till I...drank a cup of good wholsom Ale, with which I was revived, enlivened and restored to my memory, so perfectly, that I had an account in my pate of every penny due my master since the Creation.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The speaker here at once attacks coffee in further confounding his brain—unhelpfully compounded by the sounds of coffee-making going on in the coffee house—and contrasts its effects on him with the 'good wholsom Ale' with which he was so powerfully revived, in blatant rejection of the soon-to-be-common beliefs regarding both coffee and alcohol—sobriety associated with the first, drunkenness with the other. The satirical form within which this attack is framed itself represents the progression of socially held beliefs regarding coffee from as recently as Bacon, who had lumped coffee and opium into the same category of intoxication.
        </p>

        <p>
          These kinds of responses, especially those made in relation to the idea of coffee as non-English or not fit for English consumption, are less of the nature of reasoned critique than a sort of explosive rejection, latching on to a variety of pathos-derived positions. Certainly these weren't the only kinds of texts within which coffee appeared: among texts that merit further notice are discussions of coffee made abroad, or within non-English cultures—that is, discussions of coffee in travel writing—but  England for the enjoyment of English readers; instructive or pragmatic treatises on how to obtain or prepare coffee, dictionaries that define the term, or law texts that relate to coffee and imports, which were less concerned with coffee's space in society than the pragmatic questions regarding its presence in England; and texts that included coffee alongside other drinks in order to rail against them collectively. Of particular interest are texts that discuss coffee within the context of politics or its role in the discussion of politics in coffee houses in this period, a connection that was often made by contemporary writers. These pose interesting questions much steeped in interregnum and restoration politics. Generally, throughout these texts and in texts written specifically about coffee houses, critics continued to deride coffee drinking in emotionally-appealing ways until the early 18th century, by which time coffee house culture was firmly in place, as much an aspect of English tradition as the drinking of alcohol.
