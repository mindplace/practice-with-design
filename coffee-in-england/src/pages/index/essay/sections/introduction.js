      From its humble public beginnings in a shed set up as London's first coffee house, coffee drinking transformed, over the course of half a century, from being a foreign, heathen Turkish tradition practiced at the expense of a Christian soul, to an accepted drink of the new culture of political debate, with all the mutual and established connotations of sobriety, intelligence, and non-debauched sociability.

    <p>Despite the availability of fascinating archival texts, few researchers have written about coffee itself. Most scholarly attention has been given to the rise of the coffee houses in the late 17th century, because coffee house culture was a space for political debate, exchange, and sociability centered on non-boisterous and non-debauched public interaction. As for the coffee drink itself, let us now focus mpre closely upon it.

    <p>Coffee is difficult to extract from the space of coffee houses, where it was overwhelmingly sold and consumed, and with which it was associated. But it had in fact been a privately consumed item in England for much of the 17th century before becoming publicly sold in coffee houses, and many contemporary discussions of coffee culture often looked specifically at coffee itself and not just at the coffee houses. Such social responses may be found in texts that discuss coffee directly, particularly in several texts printed during the latter half of the seventeenth century, the early rise of English coffee houses. These texts shine a fascinating light on opinions regarding coffee: sometimes social, sometimes medicinal, often mixed. All these texts represent participation in an ongoing struggle to determine coffee's place in English culture, as the commodity of coffee throughout this period is 'fitful and uncertain' and remained that way until the 1720s. For it was certain that coffee, as any other foreign novelty, was something 'to be looked at askance'.
