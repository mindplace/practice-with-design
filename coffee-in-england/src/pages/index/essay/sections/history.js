    <h2>How did coffee get to England?</h2>
    <p>Coffee came to England slowly, becoming a widely-consumed product primarily after the opening of the first coffee shop in London, most likely in 1652. The coffee drinking habit was imported from Ottoman-controlled Turkey by English travelers and traders, although coffee houses and coffee drinking had only been established in Istanbul after 1554. English travelers and Levant Company traders began to import coffee to England for private consumption, where it was at first consumed and discussed primarily by English virtuosi, men of science and learning. Among these was William Harvey, a well-known physician who discovered the circulation of the blood, who most likely began drinking coffee as early as 1627. Others were Thomas Howard, the fourteenth Earl of Arundel, and Francis Bacon. Bacon in particular wrote extensively on coffee and some excerpted texts entered circulation and publication throughout the 17th century.

    <p>Public coffee consumption was introduced into London through Daniel Edwards, an up-and-coming merchant of the Levant Company. When Edwards returned to England, he brought home a coffee-drinking habit, to the interest of his friends. Noting their interest, Edwards conceived of an idea&mdash;along with his father-in-law, Thomas Hodges, originally of the Grocers Company&mdash;to open an establishment where people could purchase coffee for their own use.</p>

    <p>However, they were prevented from opening this shop because the Levant Company forbade their traders to sell their goods directly. Luckily, Edwards kept a manservant, Pasqua Rosee, originally from Ottoman-controlled Smyrna, whom he had hired after a long period abroad there. Edwards decided to sponsor Rosee in opening the coffee shop and to be the face of that establishment. There, they sold prepared coffee, ground coffee, and coffee beans.</p>
