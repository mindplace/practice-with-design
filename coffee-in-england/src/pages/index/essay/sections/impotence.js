    <h2>Impotence and Immorality</h2>

    <p>A great deal of coffee talk seemed quite concernd with sexuality. 'Benjamin Bad-cock drank Coffee in Layden, and his Wife...remained barren four years, after which he left drinking Coffee, and in three quarters of a year she had a goodly chopping boy'. This was a common attack on coffee from the beginning of coffee's presence in England. Both advocates and critics widely discussed the concept of 'dryness' of coffee&mdash;its ability to stimulate the mind and reduce fluids in the body, among them male sperm and, by extension, male virility, and inhibiting the sexuality of both sexes. The German physician Simon Paulli, in a tract published in 1665, first suggested this theory in Europe. Adam Olearius, another German physician, also claimed it, in the embassy to Persia in the Ottoman Empire, in a travel text written in 1634 and translated to English from German. It was repeated in most of the texts discussing coffee in this period in claiming that 'Coffee, that curs'd liquor disables the most valiant Hectors in the universe'. The newly enfeebled and sexually incapacitated quality of men, 'The Women's Petition' argues, must be attributed to

      This text belongs to another mock petition positioning itself as having been written by a group of concerned women. It in part echoes a text published 13 years previously, which claims that drinkers of 'pernicious' coffee are 'grown as impotent as Age, as dry and unfruitful as the Deferts of Africk', a text similarly styled as a petition to the king to make coffee drinking illegal to anyone under the age of 30.

      'The Women's Petition' was answered by a text defending coffee against its attacks, published in the same year under the title 'The Mens Answer to the Womens Petition Against Coffee'. It called coffee an 'innocent', 'harmless and healing Liquor'. It claimed that, far from inhibiting male virility, coffee 'makes the erection more Vigorous, the Ejaculation more full, adds a spiritualescency to the Sperme, and renders it more firm and suitable to the Gusto of the womb, and proportionate to the ardours and expectation too, of the female Paramour'. Its claims were thus styled as scientific fact and without a doubt, quite rigorously researched!
