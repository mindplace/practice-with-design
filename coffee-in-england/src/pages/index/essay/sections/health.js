    <h2>Interesting Health Claims</h2>

    <p>The shop printed what was perhaps the first public advertisement for coffee, titled 'The Vertue of the Coffee Drink', containing a list of coffee's 'vertues' and the shop's address, which was reprinted a number of times over the next two decades. This advertisement was 'probably folded up and enclosed in parcels of retail coffee beans' and probably also handed out and posted on walls. The advertisement detailed how coffee should be drunk and during what times of the day, and claimed it is good for digestion, eyes, headaches, coughs, dropsy, gout, scurvy, miscarriage, and the spleen, as well as good for one's spirits and prevents drowsiness, which virtue can 'make one fit for business'. Coffee's qualities were claimed to be 'cold and dry' in that it does not heat or inflame the body&mdash;part of the standard theory of humors&mdash;but has a 'drying' effect.</p>

    <p>The origins for these health claims were likely derived from sources such as Bacon, who discussed coffee in both his <i>Sylva Sylvarum</i> and <i>Historia Vitae et Mortis</i>, where he classified coffee together with 'betel roots and leaves, tobacco, and opium' as being 'of the same nature with opiates'. Bacon thought so well of coffee for its medicinal properties that he wrote he would rather prescribe coffee for a sick person than send them to the apothecary. Bacon claimed that coffee 'comforteth the Brain, and Heart, and helpeth Digestion'. Indeed, people believed these claims: they were often repeated in a variety of advertisements and pamphlets written by both critics and advocates.</p>

    <p>One text that raises these claims to refute them is 'The Maidens Complaint', which argued that while coffee in its dryness may be good for getting phlegm out of the stomach, the nature of humans is such that this and other problems return again within a short period of time, more strongly than before in that 'the house being thus swept and cleaned, seven Devils enter it'. While this did not refute the original health claim but merely labeled it useless, it did consider other medical claims more critically. It argued that not only does coffee not prevent 'the Stone, / The Palsie, Dropsie, Gout, Feaver and Ptisick' among others, it actually caused them, and elaborated this claim in a dialogue between a charlatan and an apothecary: a character called Antidote, in language parodying that of a physician, claimed that coffee is a 'rare liquor, good for several diseases, an infallible Medicine I'le promise you for the Gout, Consumption, Dropsie, Ptisick, and all other Maladies' yet aside to his apothecary friend, confided that coffee 'is the only liquor in the universe, to fill the body with diseases, it drys up the brains, putrifies the blood, shrinks up the Sinews, Nerves, Arteries and corodes upon every part of the body' and added that he was 'sure to have patients enow infected to fill my Coffers'.
    </p>

    <p>Through Antidote, who was introduced on the cover of the pamphlet as a 'mountibank'&mdash;charlatan or quack&mdash;the text insinuated that anyone making such medical claims for coffee's medicinal powers fabricates them entirely as a means of making money. (Of course, in regards to the original advertisement of Rosee's, this insinuation surely reflected some truth.) In the same text, in a dialogue between Dorothy and Jean, stand-ins for all womenkind, complain that the coffee their men are drinking makes them 'dry' and that this will shorten their lives and make a 'Jaques' of their brains, a 'chimney of his noddle'. The claim that coffee hurts the brain is interesting for the term 'Jaques', certainly a disparagingly French reference. One woman then claims that rather than drink coffee, she would prefer to 'wrap my Maiden-head in my smock, and fling it into the Ocean to be bugger'd to death by young Lobsters', appealing to the reader's sense of shock, outrage, and perhaps a bit of low-brow humor while in the same breath claiming an association between coffee and the loss of female sexual availability. The other character answers that she would rather 'hang my Maiden-head on a Wind-mill to be bated to death by the four Winds, rather than be poyson'd with the scent of old crusts, and threads of Leather burn'd and beaten to powder, of which I believe this cursed Coffee is made'. In other texts, coffee is similarly bizarrely disparaged as 'A loathsome Potion...Syrrop of Soot, or Effence of old Shooes'.
    </p>

    <p>In response to 'The Maidens Complaint' was printed another satirical pamphlet titled 'The Coffee-Mans Granado Discharged Upon the Maidens Complaint Against Coffee', which satirized the first in mimicking its style of informing through dialogue. The text presented itself as a proponent of coffee in opposition to 'The Maidens Complaint', but actually further criticized coffee while pretending to advocate for it. It called coffee 'infallible for all Maladies' and proposed to list the 'rare Cures' that coffee drinking inspired, such as:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Rickard Banco of Catolongo lay of a dead Palsie three years, and drinking Coffee, was so perfectly cur'd, that the next day he was seen to go throrow the High-street upon 4 mens shoulders, to the admiration of his Neighbours who had not seen him some years before.
    </blockquote>

    <p>While Banco dies the next day, the text presents this and other events as wonderful and desirable&mdash;in one of these 'rare Cures', a character who had suffered from coffee expresses an intention to write a book to praise it, which one of the characters holding dialogue comments on, saying he intends to purchase the book when it is printed.
