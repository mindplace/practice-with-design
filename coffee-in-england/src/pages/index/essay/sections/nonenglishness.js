    <h2>The Non-Englishness of Coffee</h2>

    <p>
      Claims of coffee as impacting health represent only one type of criticism and social responses that coffee garnered. Coffee was often positioned as being inherently non-English: sometimes Turkish, sometimes hellish, often simply 'forein'. Proponents of coffee tended to mention its Turkish origins as part of its history, while critics used such facts to suggest that in being non-English, coffee was therefore not fit for English consumption. The 'Maidens Complaint Against Coffee' calls it an 'Indian liquor' that 'is a drench for the Devil', noting that 'Indian' and hellish are not necessarily unrelated concepts to a nationalistic-minded writer. Calling coffee a drink for the Devil, or claiming that coffee gets its heat from hell, also recurs throughout, with some texts claiming that 'Rather than I will such damn'd liquor take, / I'le drink the waters of the Stygian Lake', while another calls coffee a 'Satanick Tipple'.

      However, the more common explanation of the immorality of coffee in these texts comes from the association between Islam and coffee consumption. Pasqua Rosee, the face and proprietor of that first coffee shop in London, was an immigrant from Ottoman-controlled Smyrna. His shop was decorated in a style reminiscent of the Ottoman Empire, and it was this, as well as the fact that Rosee did not speak English well, that contributed to the already-established association between coffee and foreign culture, which had already been in place thanks to the publication of travel writing. This association was compounded by later coffee houses, which typically displayed Turkish iconology on their signs. The association between Islam and coffee provided, for critics, straightforward evidence for the immoral nature of coffee drinking. Some texts consider coffee with simple suspicion, calling it a 'Turkish Enchantress', insinuating that coffee has a magical and disastrous effect on a Christian's soul. Another, echoing common Christian teaching, reminds readers that 'No Faith is to be kept with Infidels' within a poem that stresses the foreign and dangerous qualities of coffee in depicting a marriage between an 'Islamic [coffee] bean and innocent Christian water'. Contemporary culture still regarded the Ottoman Empire as 'a vehicle for the forces of the Anti-Christ', which still inspired demands to go on holy war against the Muslims. Under such circumstances, Turkish customs, no matter how recently introduced to that part of the world, were still fraught, for the English public, with associations with immorality. One woodcut, accompanying a text critical of coffee, depicts exotic figures mingling with English customers, appealing to viewers who presumably shared fears of such improper mixes with the artist. This fear was directly represented textually in a satirical poem:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      For Men and Christians to turn Turks, and think<br />
      T' excuse the Crime because 'tis in their drink,<br />
      Is more then Magick, and does plainly tell<br />
      Coffee's extraction has its heats from Hell.â€¨
    </blockquote>

    <p>The same poem calls coffee drinkers 'English Apes', in that Englishmen mimic the Turks by drinking coffee as though they are worthy of emulation, and moreover, that coffee drinkers become as animals in their repudiation of Englishness by partaking of foreign consumption. Another text similarly complains that 'the Offspring of our Mighty Ancestors Dwindled into a Succession of Apes and Pignies' through coffee-drinking. Yet another likens coffee consumers to 'Apes' and 'Slaves' in imitating the peoples of other nations: 'With the Barbarous Indian he smoaks Tobacco. With the Turk he drinks Coffee', diminishing the civility and Christianity of the consumer.</p>

    <p>This foreignness of coffee and its immorality is constantly contrasted with the Englishness of alcohol: 'instead of Coffee, wee'l have a cup of wholesome Ale' since coffee is poisonous and unhealthy for English constitutions, perhaps intended to be so by the Devil. Critics complained that coffee drinkers neglect alcohol, the proper drink of Englishmen: 'by this poor Arabian Berry, / Comes the Neglect of Malago and Sherry'. Others again make a connection between moral danger and foreign goods, in saying that men who drink coffee 'Apostize from the good old primitive way of Ale-drinking, to run whoreing after such variety of distructive Foraign Liquors...all for a little base, black, thick, nasty, bitter, stinking, nauseous Puddle-water'.
    </p>

    <p>Advocates of coffee responded to the coffee-alcohol debate by stressing the fact that coffee induces sobriety and alertness, which qualities were used to contrast with alcohol in praise of coffee. In challenge of this, 'The Women's Petition' claims that men 'pretend 'twill [coffee] keep them Waking, but we find by scurvy Experience, they sleep quietly enough after it'. Still, the pervasive association between coffee and sobriety suggests that coffee and coffee house patrons were claiming a civil sociability in drinking coffee. John Beale, for example, wrote of hopes that coffee 'may bee a meanes to put drunkennes out of countenance'. A 1674 poem similarly hopes that coffee means an end to debauched sociability:</p>

    <blockquote>
      the sweet Poison of the Treacherous Grape,<br/>
      Had Acted on the world a General Rape,<br/>
      [...] Then Heaven in Pity, to Effect our Cure,<br/>
      And stop the Ragings of that Calenture,<br/>
      First sent amongst us this All-healing Berry,<br/>
      At once to make us both Sober and Merry.
    </blockquote>

      Coffee is here connected to heaven, just as critics claim its alignment with hell, yet both suggest that one drink is meant to supplant the other, or that one drink will soothe the negative effects of the other, as 'Maidens Complaint' claims ale will do for coffee:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      I travel'd to the Royal Exchange, to collect certain sums of mony due to my Master...and by the confused noise of several Languages, I was so confounded in my noddle that my brains ran to and fro like a foot-boy...I went into a Coffee-house, took a dish of that Hell-burn'd liquor, thinking to settle them [my brains] in their right Center, with the ratling noice of Kettles, Skimers and Ladles amongst the Brasiers, my brains run round so swift as a Wind-mill, and all my joynts were as num as an old Womans trubled with the dead Palsy 30 years togather, till I...drank a cup of good wholsom Ale, with which I was revived, enlivened and restored to my memory, so perfectly, that I had an account in my pate of every penny due my master since the Creation.
    </blockquote>

      The speaker is in blatant rejection of the soon-to-be-common beliefs regarding both coffee and alcohol&mdash;sobriety associated with the first, drunkenness with the other. The satirical form within which this attack is framed itself represents the progression of socially-held beliefs regarding coffee from as recently as Bacon, who had lumped coffee and opium into the same category of intoxication.

      These kinds of responses, especially those made in relation to the idea of coffee as non-English or not fit for English consumption, are less of the nature of reasoned critique than a sort of explosive rejection, latching on to a variety of pathos-derived positions. Certainly these weren't the only kinds of texts within which coffee appeared: among texts that merit further notice are discussions of coffee made abroad, or within non-English cultures&mdash;that is, discussions of coffee in travel writing; instructive or pragmatic treatises on how to obtain or prepare coffee, dictionaries that define the term, or law texts that relate to coffee and imports, which were less concerned with coffee's space in society than the pragmatic questions regarding its presence in England; and texts that included coffee alongside other drinks in order to rail against them collectively. Of particular interest are texts that discuss coffee within the context of politics or its role in the discussion of politics in coffee houses in this period, a connection that was often made by contemporary writers. These pose interesting questions much steeped in interregnum and restoration politics. Generally, throughout these texts and in texts written specifically about coffee houses, critics continued to deride coffee drinking in emotionally-appealing ways until the early 18th century, by which time coffee house culture was firmly in place, as much an aspect of English tradition as the drinking of alcohol.
