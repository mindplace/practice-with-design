          <p>Some of my favorite memories in my life were made by the teas I was drinking. The realization of 
          the pervasive nature of my culture hit me viscerally as I watched my 3-year-old niece drink hot  
          tea from a little cup. The taste of home with my mother was always the Jasmine green tea she bought in 
          Chinatown, those little packets boxed and individually packaged. The feeling of being comforted by familiary and yet 
          estranged from comfort by the single-serving herbal teas served in countless social functions. </p>
          <p>Travelling, too, there was tea, buckets of it. My memories of living in London are only tactile when 
          I think of the black tea with milk that my friend taught me to make "perfectly": golden, rich, and hot (i.e. the way she said 
          the English took it). My sister opened many foreign culinary worlds for me as we drank mint tea in a 
          tiny Moroccan street cafe, genmaicha green tea with salmon sashimi, and barley tea over kimchi in her 
          favorite Korean restaurant in Manhattan.</p>
          <p>Then there was the green tea phase, kicked off by my college roommate, whose uncle owned a tea 
          emporium in China. I fell in love with matcha and roasted green tea, and teas with names like Dragon Pearl
          or Green Jade. A friend around that time brought back some ti-guan-yin tea from China, and I hardly 
          blinked before I finished it all. Its smoky, subtle and rich flavors drove me to try every oolong tea I could 
          find in the tiny Montreal tea shop in which I wrote my dissertation over many beautiful, long summer days.</p>
          <p>Right now it's Earl Grey that acts as fuel to biological gears. The subtle taste of bergamot lingers 
          even through the additions of sugar and milk. And when I'm out again, well, there's always that Golden Leaves oolong 
          to fall back on.</p>
