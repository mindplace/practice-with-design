      <p>Sometime around 1350, an anonymous person writing as one Sir John Mandeville penned a 
      little English book of wonders. This Mandeville was chiefly concerned with conveying his 
      supposed <i>Travels</i> to Jerusalem and then onwards through Asia, incorporating a wide variety 
      of wonders which he bade the reader to believe were meant to be taken as truthful--monstrous 
      races, improbable lands, bizarre tales. This little book, far from falling into obscurity 
      and disuse, saw an explosion of interest all the way through the 17th century at which 
      point it was finally, with some pain, put to rest as not being a factual travel account. 
      Nevertheless, it was extremely popular throughout this long period, and particularly during 
      the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>
      <p>These two centuries saw an explosion in the interest 
      in and publication of the literature of travel, to the point that this genre's publication 
      rate and readership was exceeded only by texts dealing with religious issues (1). The <i>Travels</i> 
      enjoyed a brilliant popularity throughout this period and, categorized as travel literature, 
      was printed more often than any 
      non-religious text. At new editions averaging every eight years 
      during the late 16th to 17th centuries, Mandeville was more popular than 
      Chaucer (2).</p>

        <figcaption>Anthropophagi</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Certainly the popularity of Mandeville's <i>Travels</i> hinged in part on the fact that 
    it contained several different genre elements that were at the time particularly relevant. There 
    was a pervasive interest in monstrous races, which was the 'essential Mandeville as far as the 
    Elizabethan reader or audience was concerned'--indeed,  Mandeville's name was often cited in 
    conjunction with monstrous races such as the Anthropophagi, and some parts of the <i>Travels</i> were 
    printed or circulated that preserved merely the sections relating to such fantastic races (3).  
    And yet the book often appeared as a cited source in such prestigious and important texts as 
    Samuel Purchas' <i>Purchas His Pilgrims</i> (1625).</p>
    <p>This growing cultural desire for travel narratives and tales of distant lands, 
    augmented by colonialist expansion and conquest, meant a steady readership even as more modern 
    travel narratives were published. Mandeville persisted even amidst such company as Sir Francis
    Drake and Martin Frobisher, perhaps because he remained, as Rebecca Ann Bach calls him, the 
    'ur-traveler' for the contemporary reading public, and his book 'a model for exploration 
    literature' (4).</p> 
    <p>Regardless of other publications, Mandeville's <i>Travels</i> was 'England's popular baseline of spatial 
    and human geography until the late sixteenth century, and, although its primacy waned rapidly 
    thereafter, its residual influence persisted for at least another century' (5). </p></section>

      <h2>The <i>Travels'</i> uncertain position as a factual text</h2>
    <p>Early scholarship suggested that Mandeville's factual credibility started facing a barrage of attacks,
    which eventually resulted in the reading public setting
    him aside. (For example, Richard Hakluyt's <i>Principall Navigations</i> excludes Mandeville from its 
    second edition while including it in the first (1589).) Some held opinions like Sir Walter 
    Raleigh's, who wrote that Mandeville's text had been 'held for fables many yeares' (6). Similarly, 
    while Samuel Purchas included Mandeville in his <i>Pilgrims</i>, Purchas did so with the disclaimer that 
    Mandeville was a ' 'famous Traveller...whose Geographie Ortelius commendeth, howesoever he 
    acknowledgheth his Worke stuffed with Fables' ' (7).</p> 
    <p>Still, the book did not fall to the realists for a good long time, thanks to the efforts of many 
    outspoken defenders. One recurring response to the <i>Travels</i>
    argued that modern travelers seemed to be confirming, rather than refuting, the information Mandeville 
    presented. One author mentions in passing that Mandeville's 'Relations deserve more credit than 
    formerly they have had' (8).  Mandeville, writes another, 'measur'd of this earthly ball / A greater 
    part then any of his time' for the good of his country, yet</p>
              <p><span>&emsp;&emsp;his Readers threw<br>Contempt upon his news, more strange than true<br>
                        Thought his reports, accounting them such toyes<br>And sigments as phantastiques 
                        oft devise.<br>Yet afterwards when travellers did make<br>Further discov'ries, 
                        and surveyes did take<br>Of this main Globe, they found his wonders true<br>In 
                        th' greater part, and gave him praises due<br>To his high merits, making him 
                        thereby<br>A just amends for wrongful obloquy. (9)<br></span></p>
    <p>New discoveries 'found his wonders true / In th' greater part' rather than discounted his 
    contribution to travel literature. As for others, some texts written in part for the benefit of 
    actual travelers, such as Richard Wiles' <i>History of Trauayle</i> (1577) and Robert Johnson's 'sober' 
    <i>Traveller's Breviat</i> (circa 1600) incorporate Mandeville 'respectfully' as an authoritative traveler 
    and perhaps even a reliable author (10). Clearly there was a well-established tradition of reading 
    Mandeville as partially fantastic but mainly realistic, in that he wrote 'true <i>Travels</i>'. In some way, 
    the question of credibility was not contained simply in Mandeville's book itself so much as the entire 
    genre of travel writing: 'there [was] a good deal of moral unease, not so much about travel writing 
    and fiction, but about how the credulous might regard not just Mandeville but travel accounts and 
    fiction in general' (11).</p>
    <p>Despite, or perhaps because of, issues relating to the factual nature of Mandeville's 
    <i>Travels</i>, authors and their literary texts often borrowed from or commented on Mandeville. 
    Raleigh, for example, cites Mandeville in two texts almost twenty years apart, suggesting an 
    'ambiguous attitude towards what was universally acknowledged at the same time as an unreliable 
    source', an attitude that is reflective of the place Mandeville held in this period: ambiguous 
    and at least partially credible (12).</p></section>

      <h2>Why did Mandeville remain so popular? Because in this period where people were starting to experience 
      the distant and the exotic, Mandeville continued to deliver wonders.</h2>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <p>Thinking about the factuality and credibility of Mandevillian lore does not seem 
    to really answer why his book was so popular. A better answer would note the reading public's 
    voracious interest in all things exotic and distant. William Wood, publishing in 1634 his account of 
    New England, explains that he had written his text to 'enrich the knowledge of the mind-travelling 
    Reader, or benefit the future Voyager': </p>
              <p><span>Wood's separation of the "mind-travelling Reader" from the "future Voyager" is 
              significant in that it reveals two quite discrete categories of readers with an interest 
              in travel literature, suggesting that the publication of such texts not only disseminated 
              pragmatic information, but also catered to the desires of readers with little or no prospect
              of actually voyaging, but who nevertheless enjoy viewing exotic shores in their minds' eyes. (13) </span></p>
    <p>David McInnes here argues that travel literature was not merely pragmatic, but fulfilled 
        the desires of 'armchair travelers' for 'exotic shores' as just one of the new types of 
              desirable products that began to become available at in England during this time. 
              Mandeville's <i>Travels</i>, as a symbol of the exotic and the distant, was slowly re-envisioned 
              as an archetype of such products on the market.  </p>

    <section>
      <p>Interest and curiosity about travel and fantastic sights abroad was caught up with 
    Mandevillian lore and expressed in literature and drama, and often could be read as commenting on 
    contemporary ideas relating to travel and the desire for the exotic. One literary text that combines
    Mandeville with factual discussions of England and places abroad is William Warner's second edition 
    of <i>Albion's England</i>, originally published in 1586 and reprinted with additions in 1596. It offered a
    history of England to the current date and 'was apparently established as a major work before being 
    almost totally forgotten' (14). Of Mandeville, Warner writes, 'VVho reads Sir Iohn de Mandeuil his Trauels,
    and his Sights, / That wonders not? and wonder may, if all be true he wrights' and adds that 'most 
    [readers], now, modernly approu'd' of Mandeville as a truthful traveler and narrator.</p>
    <p>In the second edition, starting from Book 11 onwards, Warner re-envisions Mandeville as a 
    knight in love with an English lady named Elenor. Warner partially recasts Mandeville's <i>Travels</i> in the 
    letters his Mandeville writes to Elenor, for example comparing her with the Amazons he encounters in 
    the <i>Travels</i>: 'The Amazones, those lustie Girles, beleeue me lik't me Well: / But nothing in the best 
    of them but doth in you excell' (15). Warner ventriloquizes Mandeville, yet places him amidst earnestly 
    written histories. His recasting of Mandeville's <i>Travels</i> makes Mandeville into 'the archetypical traveler-figure, 
    ideal patron for a discussion of England's maritime exploits' which Warner spends some time recounting (16).
    There is a sense here of a kind of nationalistic and prideful propaganda, which Mandeville's presence 
    supports as a definitively English and grandiose traveler. Warner's use of Mandeville reflects the
    partially-credible reception the <i>Travels</i> enjoyed--as a useful and entertaining participant among more 
    credible travel accounts. </p></section>

      <h2>The Mandevillian traveller in <i>Othello</i></h2>
    <p>Mandeville shows up in Shakespeare's <i>Othello</i>, in Othello's 
    speech explaining how it was that Desdemona had fallen in love with him. Both she and Brabantio, 
    Othello says, 'questioned me the story of my life', which he obligingly related to them both. 
    Othello has quite a 'traveller's history', signaling, with this phrase, a very Mandevillian kind 
    of past, just as he mentions elements commonly attributed to Mandeville (17).  He has seen, Othello claims, </p>
            <p><span>&emsp;&emsp;the cannibals that each other eat,<br>The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads<br>Do 
            grow beneath their shoulders. These things to hear<br>Would Desdemona seriously incline, [...]<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;and with a greedy ear<br>Devour up my discourse... (18)<br></span></p>
            <p>It is merely the relation of his story, Othello says, that makes Desdemona fall in love with 
            him, and at the end of his speech, having made it in answer to Brabantio's claim that Othello 
            had bewitched his daughter, says that 'This is the only witchcraft I have used' (19). Mandevillian 
            lore, here, is at the heart of the 'witchcraft' that enthralls Desdemona. The cultural commentary 
            here is on those people who, like Desdemona, find themselves enthralled with the monsters and 
            'odd discoveries' of Mandevillian lore and travel narratives in general. They 'devour' such 
            tales and are bewitched by them. Othello represents the theatre itself as a place where such 
            tales and creatures are played, for the enticement and enthralled interest of audience-as-Desdemona. 
            He is the 'alien witness', as Ladan Niayesh calls him, in relating to Desdemona the strange 
            people and places he has seen, thus becoming himself a Mandevillian figure (20). He parallels <i>Albion's 
            England</i> in the way his <i>Travels</i> are related to Desdemona explicitly for her entertainment and 
            resulting in her affection. Just as Warner creates a romantic image of a knight relating his tales 
            to his lady, raising her up as he does, so does Shakespeare cast Othello in this heroic position 
            in relation to Desdemona. </p>

    although the powerful association between Mandeville and such monstrous races mentioned here suggests that
    Mandevillian lore was at least partially being referenced. </p>

      <h2>And yet, all this pleasure in the exotic and the distant can be addictive, and 
      Mandeville's book was the best example of it.</h2>
  <p>The literature of travel is personal, fulfilling, and pleasurable; it entertains 
    and fulfills the desire for alterity and the exotic without inconveniencing the would-be traveler 
    with actual travel. Yet it is also addictive; it may beguile to the point of leaving readers 
    lacking the desire to continue living normal lives. Or such is the premise of Richard Brome's 
    <i>The Antipodes</i>, a play in which young Peregrine, an avid reader of Mandeville, is losing his mind 
    to his desire to experience exotic lands and races. Peregrine holds Mandeville in such high respect 
    that he thinks 'Iohn [Mandeville] / Dwels up almost at Paradice' (21).  The Doctor, called in to cure 
    Peregrine of his madness, acknowledges that 'Mandevile went farre' and asks what Peregrine thinks 
    of 'Drake, our famous Countriman'; Peregrine answers, 'Drake was a Dy'dapper to Mandevile, / Candish, 
    and Hawkins, Furbisher, all our voyagers / Went short of Mandevile' (22).  His mad esteem for Mandeville 
    comments on contemporary culture that similarly held Mandeville as a particularly interesting 
    and important English traveler, regardless of the availability of more contemporary accounts. 
    Brome argues, through Peregrine's madness, that while Mandeville may have some truth 
    to him, his book is problematic because of its enthralling nature, the way it allows people to 
    become addicted to travel and exotic lands. He echoes Ben Jonson's Lord Frampul, who too discusses 
    his <i>Travels</i> in terms of addiction:  </p>
              <p><span>&emsp;&emsp;I am he<br>Have measur'd al the Shires of <i>England</i> over:<br><i>Wales</i>, 
              and her Mountains, seen those wilder Nations,<br>Of People in the <i>Peak</i>, and <i>Lancashire</i>;<br>
              Their Pipers, Fidlers, Rushers, Puppet-masters,<br>Juglers and Gypsies, all the sorts of Canters,<br>
              And Colonies of Beggars, Tumblers, Ape carriers;<br>For to these Savages I was addicted,<br>
              To search their Natures, and make odd Discoveries!<br>And here my Wife, like a she-<i>Mandevile</i>,<br>
              Ventred in disquisition after me. (23)<br></span></p>
    <p>Frampul 'implies that he is constitutionally a Mandeville', styling himself an explorer rather 
    than a puppet-master, and his catalog of peoples are the 'exotic races' of the English countryside
    which he has explored (24). Even his wife that he calls a 'she-Mandevile', in the way she 'ventred 
    in disquisition' after him, becomes Mandevillian in her following him--just as Peregrine becomes Mandevillian in 
    wishing to emulate his hero.</p> 
    <p>Brome's <i>Antipodes</i> is based on the question of the addictive quality of the desire for 
    exotic travel. As David McInnis argues, '<i>The Antipodes</i> is very much about travel, but specifically 
    about the psychology of travel, not the physicality of voyaging' in theorizing 'a common travel 
    concern that had never before received such full attention on stage: a humor that can best be described 
    as a combination of wanderlust and vicarious travel' (25). Peregrine suffers of 'Mandeville-based fantasies' 
    for monstrous races and strange places; it
    represents the 'moral and social decay [that] was already endemic to Renaissance London' (26):  
    Peregrine's 'addiction' is used as a mirror serving to reflect overly-avid readers of travel literature. 
    Brome shows that desire for exotic travel has 'captured the English imagination'; it is not 'actual 
    travel or the political context in which most early modern travel occurred' that is important, but 
    rather the way people become immersed in such fantastical adventures as Mandeville provides for Peregrine 
    and the reading public at large (27).</p>

      <h2>Mandeville humanizes the monstrous, and <i>The Tempest</i> concurs: who are we to judge,
      when the world really may be full of wonders?</h2>
    <p>Mandevillian tales are more than just addictive. There is a sense of truthfulness  
    somewhere in the fantastic tales presented in travel literature, as Shakespeare's <i>Tempest</i> points out. Antonio,
    having seen Prospero's island and some of the natives, declaring that he will now believe what travelers 
    claim, pronounces, 'Travellers ne'er did lie, / Though fools at home condemn 'em' (28).  Sebastian and Gonzalo 
    agree:</p>
            <p><span><i>Sebastian</i>: [...] Now will I believe<br>That there are unicorns, that in Arabia<br>There 
            is one tree, the phoenix's throne, one phoenix<br>At this hour reigning there. (29)<br></span></p>
            <p>The phoenix, described in the <i>Travels</i>, is one of the more easily recognizable mythical elements 
            of the book. Sebastian, in announcing his belief, underscores that he does so in real time: the 
            phoenix, he says, is 'At this hour reigning' in Arabia, in existence at the very moment of his 
            speech. Gonzalo, in turn, contemplates whether he would be believed in Europe if he tried to 
            describe what he had seen:</p>
            <p><span><i>Gonzalo</i>: If in Naples<br>
                      I should report this now, would they believe me--<br>
                      If I should say, I saw such islanders?<br>
                      For certes these are people of the island,<br>
                      Who though they are of monstrous shape, yet note,<br>
                      Their manners are more gentle-kind than of<br>
                      Our human generation you shall find<br>
                      Many, nay, almost any. [...]<br>
                      &emsp;&emsp;When we were boys,<br>
                      Who would believe that there were mountaineers<br>
                      Dewlapped like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em<br>
                      Wallets of flesh? Or that there were such men<br>
                      Whose heads stood in their breasts? (30)<br></span></p>
      <p>Not only does he acknowledge the monstrous natives he had seen as real, but humanizes them by 
      complimenting their manners, being more 'gentle-kind' than those of normal people, closely echoing 
      the way Mandeville's book often deals matter-of-factly with the monstrous races he encounters. Gonzalo also mentions
      mountaineers, or people living in mountainous regions, and equates them with 'men / Whose heads [stand]
      in their breasts', a reference to Mandeville's Blemmye. Gonzalo here suggests that in having grown up 
      and realized the reality of mountaineers, despite his lack of geographic proximity, so should he believe 
      in the Blemmye. He is claiming that travel has made him more credulous in that the world really does 
      hold the sorts of fantastical beings that Mandeville offers.</p>

      <p>Mandeville's influence in literature dealing with exotic places reaches far. Mandevillian 
    lore seems present in a variety of texts of this period, whether by being mentioned or discussed directly 
    or simply being an important text for shaping how people thought about travel literature. It touches 
    Marlowe's <i>Tamburlaine</i>, regarding which Richard Hillman argues that contemporary audiences 'may have 
    thought' of Mandeville while watching it, because of mentions such as that of Prester John as a king in 
    Africa (31). Charles Mosley similarly argues that Sir Thomas More may have drawn on Mandeville for <i>Utopia</i>, 
    although it seems more likely that More's text simply brings Mandeville to mind through the close 
    association between his text and the literature of travel in general, in its exploration of English 
    culture shown by contrasting it with a very different kind of place (32). That is, <i>Utopia</i>, and texts such as 
    <i>The Island Princess</i>, may be associated with Mandeville in the way Mandeville shares with such texts a
    readership base, and in that both Mandeville and the early modern texts straddle ground between social 
    interest in the exotic and early colonialist propaganda. In this way, even as he was still being read 
    in the early modern, Mandeville's <i>Travels</i> slowly began participating in the literature of colonialism,
    as the question of exotic peoples and places abroad became one of conquest as well as discovery, as 
    highlighted in the connection between his book and works such as <i>Eastward Hoe</i>, <i>The Antipodes</i>, <i>The Island
    Princess</i>, and others. </p></section>

    <section><p>Mandeville may have been slowly losing his authority as a 'true traveler', although some
    writers contended for a while of the rise, rather than the fall, of his credibility. Regardless, his 
    book remained an important text for social issues relating to travel, especially, as this paper has 
    shown, to literature and drama, and remained at the forefront of the literature of travel well into 
    the 17th century. </p></section>
